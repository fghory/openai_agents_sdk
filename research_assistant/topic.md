- **May 2025:** During a skirmish between India and Pakistan, the J-10C reportedly engaged and downed an Indian Rafale jet, marking a significant milestone for Chinese military technology.

## International Deployments and Exports

The J-10C has gained international attention, with several countries expressing interest in acquiring the aircraft. Key international deployments and exports include:

- **Pakistan:** In March 2022, Pakistan inducted its first batch of J-10C fighters into the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), designated as J-10CE (a customized export variant). This acquisition was seen as a response to India's procurement of Rafale jets.
- **Joint Exercises:** PAF J-10Cs participated in joint exercises with Qatar's Eurofighter Typhoons in January 2024, enhancing interoperability and testing the J-10C's performance against Western platforms.
- **Operational Use in Pakistan:** In January 2024, PAF J-10Cs were involved in airstrikes against insurgent groups in Iran, demonstrating their operational versatility.
- **Egypt:** Egypt has reportedly placed an order for J-10C fighters to replace its aging F-16 fleet, indicating the aircraft's growing appeal in the international market.

## Comparative Analysis

The J-10C is often compared to Western fighter aircraft such as the French Dassault Rafale and the American F-16V. Here's a comparative analysis:

### J-10C vs. Rafale:

- **Performance**: The J-10C boasts a higher maximum speed (Mach 2.2) and service ceiling (60,000 feet) compared to the Rafale (Mach 1.8 speed and 50,000 feet ceiling).
- **Range**: The Rafale has a superior range of 3,700 km with external fuel tanks, compared to the J-10C's 2,940 km.
- **Armament**: Both aircraft are equipped with advanced air-to-air missiles; the Rafale utilizes the Meteor missile (range ~200 km), while the J-10C employs the PL-15 missile (estimated range between 250-300 km).
